//INTRODUCTION

Hello, I am Harsh Goyal
i have developed this weather forecasting application for the assignment for MIRRAR

--> I have used weather api source for the api used in this project with limited content which does'nt cover the 5 day forecast part 
i can use openweathermap for this but somehow i'm getting some sort off error to fetch the API.
i have did almost 80% of the task and rest can be done if i had 2-3 days more..

-->This project covers all the part of responsiveness and and UI/UX part, i have used Reactjs , tailwindCSS for frontend and WeatherAPI to fetch the real time data of the weather.

//Installation

--> cd to the WeatherApp-main
--> install node modules (npm i) in the terminal
--> Vite tool is used hence for start use(npm run dev)
--> navigate the link and visit to the webpage 

Thank You
